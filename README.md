Game Engine 2D - Vanilla Javascript

This project is designed to improve my skills at javascript, html and css. It is also for
people who want to create 2D games but dont know how to code or their code knowledge is limited.

My goal is to create this engine with an interactive ui and help anyone to create a game without
needing to code. I also plan add a scripting interpreter later but the main focus will be having premade
components that people can use and change their properties according to their needs.
My self not used to code in javascript but i will also learn a lot about this journey, but my personal
experience from other languages like java and c# will help me a lot i believe.

I have been using Unity Game engine since my 12 years old, so i will be inspiring myself from their layout
and mechanisms. Feel free to comment any change, improvement or bug you may find and i encourage you to
suggest new ideas and help me turning this code better. Thanks :)
